                <p>Michael Scalise - The details of my life are quite inconsequential.... My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery.

Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.</p>
